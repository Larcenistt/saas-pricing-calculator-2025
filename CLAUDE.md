## Development Guidelines

1. **CLAUDE RULES.md Compliance**:
   - Always plan with TodoWrite before making changes
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Never be lazy - find root causes
   - Document all changes

2. **Simplicity First**:
   - No complex features without user request
   - Frontend-only (no backend needed)
   - Use existing solutions (Stripe Buy Button)

3. **User Experience**:
   - No dark patterns
   - Fast page loads (< 2s)
   - Professional appearance
   - Clear value proposition

## Testing Checklist

Before any deployment:
1. Run `npm run build` successfully
2. Test Buy Button loads without flashing
3. Verify calculator calculations
4. Test PDF export
5. Check all page routes work
6. Verify mobile responsiveness

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Buy Button Not Loading**:
- Check Stripe script in index.html
- Verify button ID is correct
- Clear browser cache

**Page Flashing**:
- Already fixed by removing countdown timer
- Loading states prevent button flash

**Redirect After Payment**:
