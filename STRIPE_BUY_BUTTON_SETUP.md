# ðŸŽ¯ Stripe Buy Button Configuration

## What You Have Now

You're using a **Stripe Buy Button** (not a Payment Link), which is better because:
- âœ… Embedded directly in your site
- âœ… Better conversion (no redirect to Stripe)
- âœ… Can configure success URL
- âœ… Automatic redirect after payment

## Setting Up Automatic Redirect

### Option 1: Configure in Stripe Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Log into Stripe Dashboard**
2. **Go to Buy Buttons**
   - Or direct link: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_links
3. **Find your button**
   - ID: `buy_btn_1RqOC7I6kujeAM5FZbqTtxFL`
4. **Click to Edit**
5. **In "After payment" section:**
   - Enable "Redirect customers to a specific page"
   - Enter: `https://saas-pricing-calculator-2025.vercel.app/success`
6. **Save changes**

### Option 2: Add Success URL in Code

If the dashboard doesn't have redirect options, update the button code:

```html
<stripe-buy-button
  buy-button-id="buy_btn_1RqOC7I6kujeAM5FZbqTtxFL"
  publishable-key="pk_live_51RqLWCI6kujeAM5FQSJbNLxHrxgCmrLqTe9187pxEGVbxxRXIeTuDMd7mv6cwAV68ufyvcBgHHRFC8dx0XT6Mxxn003tmk9NAN"
  success-url="https://saas-pricing-calculator-2025.vercel.app/success"
>
</stripe-buy-button>
```

## What's Been Updated

1. **Embedded Buy Button** in your site
2. **Styled to match** your premium dark theme
3. **Two buttons**:
   - Main pricing card
   - Final CTA section

## Testing

1. Click the buy button on your site
2. Should open Stripe checkout in a modal/popup
3. Complete purchase
4. Should redirect to success page

## Advantages Over Payment Link

- **Higher conversion** - stays on your site
- **Better UX** - no jarring redirect
- **Automatic redirect** - when configured
- **Custom styling** - matches your brand

## If Redirect Doesn't Work

The success page will still work if customers:
1. Complete payment
2. Close the popup
3. Click "Access Calculator" button

But automatic redirect is much better for conversion!
