# ðŸ”„ Setting Up Automatic Redirect After Payment

## âœ… What I've Done

1. **Added success-url attribute** to your Buy Button code:
   ```html
   success-url="https://saas-pricing-calculator-2025.vercel.app/success"
   ```

2. **Created a test page** at `/test.html` to verify everything is working

## Current Flow vs Desired Flow

### Current Flow (May Need Dashboard Config)
1. Customer clicks Buy Button
2. Stripe checkout opens in modal
3. Completes payment
4. Modal closes (may not redirect)
5. Has to click "Access Calculator"

### Desired Flow âœ…
1. Customer clicks Buy Button
2. Stripe checkout opens in modal
3. Completes payment
4. **Automatically redirects to your success page**
5. Calculator is immediately available

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Test Current Setup

Visit: https://saas-pricing-calculator-2025.vercel.app/test.html
- Check all status indicators
- Test the buy button
- See if redirect works automatically

### Step 2: Configure Stripe Buy Button (If Redirect Not Working)

1. **Log into Stripe Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com

2. **Navigate to Buy Buttons**
   - Click "Payment Links" or "Buy Buttons" in the sidebar
   - Or search for your button

3. **Find Your Buy Button**
   - Look for button ID: `buy_btn_1RqOC7I6kujeAM5FZbqTtxFL`
   - It should show "$99.00" as the price

4. **Edit the Buy Button**
   - Click on the button
   - Click "Edit" or settings icon

5. **Configure Success Behavior**
   - Look for "After payment" or "Success behavior" section
   - Enable "Redirect customers to a specific page"
   - Enter success URL:
   ```
   https://saas-pricing-calculator-2025.vercel.app/success
   ```

6. **Save Changes**
   - Click "Save" at the bottom

### Step 2: Test the New Flow

1. Visit your site
2. Click "Get Instant Access"
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Complete payment
5. **You should automatically land on the success page with calculator**

### Step 3: Additional Improvements (Optional)

#### A. Add Loading State
The success page now captures the session ID from the URL. You could:
- Verify the payment with Stripe API
- Show personalized welcome message
- Send welcome email automatically

#### B. Protect Calculator Access
Currently anyone can access `/calculator` directly. To fix:
1. Check for valid purchase in localStorage
2. Redirect non-purchasers to landing page
3. Add server-side verification (requires backend)

#### C. Better Email Flow
1. Set up Stripe to send custom receipts
2. Include calculator access link in receipt
3. Add customer to email list for updates

## Alternative: Stripe Checkout (More Control)

If Payment Links don't support redirect in your region, consider:

1. **Switch to Stripe Checkout Sessions**
   - Requires simple backend (can use Vercel Functions)
   - Full control over success/cancel URLs
   - Can capture customer email/name

2. **Use a Service**
   - Gumroad
   - Lemon Squeezy
   - Paddle
   - These handle everything including taxes

## Quick Fixes Without Stripe Changes

If you can't edit the Payment Link settings:

1. **Add Clear Instructions**
   - On the landing page, mention to return after payment
   - Send follow-up email with access link

2. **Use Browser Storage**
   - Set a flag before redirect
   - Check flag on return to show success message

3. **Create a Simple Welcome Page**
   - `/welcome` page with access instructions
   - Share this link in your confirmation emails
