# Frequently Asked Questions - SaaS Pricing Calculator

## General Questions

### What is the SaaS Pricing Calculator?
It's a web-based tool that analyzes your current pricing, compares it to competitors, and generates optimized pricing recommendations in under 5 minutes. Think of it as an automated pricing consultant.

### Who is this for?
- SaaS founders and CEOs
- Product managers responsible for pricing

## Results & Implementation

### What if I don't have competitors?
You can use industry benchmarks or similar products as reference points. The calculator will still provide value based on your current pricing.

### Should I implement the exact prices recommended?
The recommendations are starting points. Consider your specific market position, brand, and customer relationships when implementing changes.

### How often should I revisit pricing?
Best practice is to review pricing every 6-12 months, or whenever you add significant new features.

### What if my customers complain about price increases?
The calculator includes messaging templates for price increases. Generally, if you provide value, customers accept reasonable increases.
