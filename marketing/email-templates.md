# Email Templates for SaaS Pricing Calculator Launch

## Template 1: Warm Outreach (Friends/Network)

**Subject:** Quick favor - just launched my first product ðŸš€

**Body:**
Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something I've been working on.

I just launched my first product - a SaaS Pricing Calculator that helps founders optimize their pricing in 5 minutes. Built this because I was tired of seeing SaaS companies leave money on the table with bad pricing.

It's $99 (one-time payment, no subscription) and gives you:
- Instant competitor analysis
- Optimized 3-tier pricing structure
- Professional PDF export for your team

Here's the link: https://saas-pricing-calculator-2025.vercel.app

If you know any SaaS founders who might find this useful, I'd really appreciate you sharing it with them. And if you have any feedback, I'd love to hear it!

Thanks so much,
[Your name]

P.S. Using code FRIEND50 for 50% off this week for my network

## Template 2: Cold Outreach to SaaS Founders

**Subject:** Your pricing might be 40% too low (quick tool to check)

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] has been growing fast - congrats!

Quick question: When did you last review your pricing? Most SaaS companies are underpriced by 30-40% according to OpenView's pricing survey.

I built a tool that analyzes your pricing against competitors and gives you optimized tier recommendations in under 5 minutes. It's what consultants charge $500+ for, but automated.

Here's what you get:
âœ“ Competitor pricing analysis
âœ“ Revenue projections with new pricing
âœ“ Professional pricing table PDF
âœ“ One-time purchase ($99) - no subscriptions

Check it out: https://saas-pricing-calculator-2025.vercel.app

No demos, no sales calls. Just buy it and use it instantly.

Worth 5 minutes to potentially increase revenue by 40%?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. 30-day money back guarantee if it doesn't provide value

## Template 3: Follow-up Email

**Subject:** Re: Your pricing might be 40% too low

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Just wanted to follow up on my previous email about the SaaS pricing calculator.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short:

- Takes 5 minutes
- Costs $99 once (what you probably spend on coffee in 2 weeks)
- Could increase your revenue by 30-40%

One founder used it last week and found they were underpriced by $20/month. With 500 customers, that's $120k/year left on the table.

Here's the link again: https://saas-pricing-calculator-2025.vercel.app

If it's not relevant, no worries! Just thought it might help.

Best,
[Your name]
