### Post 2: Problem/Solution Story

True story:

Last month, a founder friend asked me to review their pricing.

Their main competitor charged $79/mo.
They charged $29/mo.
"We offer more features," they said.

We increased their price to $49/mo.
Result? Zero churn. 70% more revenue.

Most SaaS companies are underpriced by 30-40%.

That's why I built a tool to fix this: https://saas-pricing-calculator-2025.vercel.app

What % are you leaving on the table?

### Post 3: Thread

How to know if your SaaS is underpriced:

1/ Your competitors charge more
2/ Customers say "that's it?" when they see pricing
3/ You haven't raised prices in 12+ months
4/ Enterprise clients sign up without negotiating
5/ Your churn is under 5%

Built a tool to fix this üëá

2/ Most founders guess their pricing.

Then wonder why growth is slow.

Here's the truth: You're probably 30-40% underpriced.

That's $300-400k/year for every $1M in revenue.

3/ Just launched: SaaS Pricing Calculator

Built a tool to help with SaaS pricing - would love feedback

Hey everyone,

I kept seeing the same problem: SaaS founders underpricing by 30-40% and leaving money on the table.

So I automated what pricing consultants do:
- Competitor analysis
- Price elasticity calculations  
- Tier optimization
- Professional PDF output

It's $99 (one-time) and takes 5 minutes.

Not trying to spam - genuinely want feedback from this community. Happy to give a few free access codes to regular contributors who'll give honest feedback.

## Engagement Responses

**When someone asks "Does it work for B2C?"**
"It's optimized for B2B SaaS, but the principles apply to B2C too. The tier structure recommendations work great for consumer apps!"

**When someone says "Seems expensive"**
"I hear you! Think of it this way: If it helps you increase pricing by just $1/customer, it pays for itself with 99 customers. Most users find 30%+ upside. Plus 30-day refund if no value."

**When someone asks for a discount**
"I get it! Instead of a discount, how about this: Use it, and if you don't find at least 20% pricing upside, I'll refund you 100%. Fair?"
